<h1>Realistic Paper Plan — ML-Driven Channel Modeling for DNA Storage</h1>

<h2>Title (working)</h2>
<p><strong>ML-Driven Simulation Framework for Adaptive Error Modeling in DNA Storage Channels</strong></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present an ML-driven channel modeling framework for DNA data storage that learns realistic substitution/insertion/deletion (SID) error distributions from sequencing data and synthetic reads, and integrates learned channels into an end-to-end benchmarking pipeline. Our learned models improve simulated realism, enable better encoder-decoder design choices, and lead to more accurate recovery predictions compared to parametric IDSChannel baselines.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>
<ul>
<li>A trainable Channel API and <code>MLChannel</code> implementation that learns conditional error models for oligo reads.</li>
<li>A curated dataset suite (synthetic + public sequencing) and reproducible training/evaluation harness integrated with existing <code>examples/benchmark_rs.py</code>.</li>
<li>Experimental evaluation showing improved match to real sequencing statistics and predictive power for recovery trade-offs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Channel model architectures: baseline n-gram/HMM, RNN (LSTM), Transformer small, and a conditional VAE for sequence-level variability. Conditioning inputs: reference sequence context, per-base features (GC, homopolymer context), and optional UMI/coverage attributes. Output modalities: per-base edit probabilities or sampleable read generators. Training objectives: maximum likelihood and calibration penalties.</p>

<h2>Datasets &amp; Synthetic Data Generation</h2>
<p>Use public DNA storage sequencing datasets as held-out tests and generate synthetic reads covering controlled ranges of substitution, deletion, insertion rates and coverage values. Provide reproducible generation scripts and metadata.</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<ol>
<li>Model quality: per-base log-likelihood and calibration.</li>
<li>Downstream impact: bench comparisons of recovery curves (parametric vs learned).</li>
<li>Ablations &amp; practical metrics (runtime, model size).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Implementation Plan &amp; Repo Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>dna_storage/components/channel/ml_channel.py</code> with <code>fit</code> and <code>transmit</code>.</li>
<li>Add dataset loaders and scripts under <code>dna_storage/data/</code> and <code>/tools</code>.</li>
<li>Add training &amp; bench examples: <code>examples/ml_train.py</code>, <code>examples/bench_ml_channel.py</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>8 weeks to draft-ready with staged deliverables: data collection, modeling, benching, ablations, writing.</p>

<h2>Additional Experiments / Datasets</h2>
<p>Insertion-heavy simulations, low-coverage sweeps, homopolymer-rich sequences, and cross-platform simulations to test generalization.</p>
